# Pet-App
This app was created for a computer science course, and the main purpose was to hone storyboard skills, so I made sure that this app works on all iOS devices, including iPads. It has a different orientation for landscape vs. portrait mode and can also be displayed nicely in split screen on the iPad.

The app allows you to feed and play with an animal, and will save your respective progress with each individual animal. The animal must be fed before it can be played with. I utilized DisplayView which was created by a previous CS student in the class.

I added sound effects when an animal is successfully played with or fed, this was outside the class instruction and I researched online to find out how to implement different sounds. The sound effects are different for playing and feeding for each animal, with a total of 10 sound effects.
